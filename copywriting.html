  <p>After working with content in one form or another for about five years and as the content strategy and copywriting lead at a national membership organization for two years, I started freelancing full-time in 2015—and haven’t looked back since.<p>

  <p>Today, I plan, create, and manage content for start ups, videographers, and travel/tourism companies.</p>

  <p>I write websites, content marketing articles, and video scripts. I help consulting clients organize their thoughts and plot out blog strategies. I helped one client double their number of paying members from 9,000 to 18,000, another quadruple their web leads, and still another double the size of their film school business.</p>
