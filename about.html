  <p class="emphasis">I create clever creative copy and films that your customers will love.</p>

<p>I’m an experienced copywriter and videographer who is location independent. Location independent means that I live and work in a variety of countries such as Japan, America, Malaysia, Thailand, South Africa, Ghana and the UK.</p>

<p>I work with small businesses, travel agencies, and multinationals to produce unique content that embodies their organization. I’ve worked with talent including pop band One Direction and TV presenter Jonathan Ross.</p>

<p>I also offer training courses and run workshops.</p>
