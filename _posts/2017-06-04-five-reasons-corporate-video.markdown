>“Revenue growth: Video ad revenue will increase at a three-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.5% through 2016, according to our estimates. That's faster than any other medium other than mobile. And much faster than traditional online display advertising, which will only grow at a 3% annual rate. “
