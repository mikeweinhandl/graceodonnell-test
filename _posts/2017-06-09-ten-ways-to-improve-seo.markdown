The internet likes website’s that are liked by other websites and the more traffic these websites have the bigger a boost will be given to your SEO.

**2) Have more pages.** The more pages on your website the better it is for your SEO.

**3)Use a dot-com or dot-net extension.** If it’s local business a country specific domain will work just as well.

**4) Use schema dot-org.** Schema markup is a way for search engines to make sense of  content in your HTML. For implementation check out this [great guide](https://moz.com/blog/schema-examples).

**5) Try to get press.** Find a journalist interested in your angle and reach out to them. Make sure you do your research, a personalized email to someone who is interested in your business is far more valuable than spamming a multitude of people.

**6) How to write your URLs.**

What’s great about using XML sitemap is that you can add include extra info which helps the search engine crawl your website and find new pages quickly.
