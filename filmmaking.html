  <h2>How I Work</h2>
  <p>When we work together it is a truly collaborative process. I take the time to get to know you and your organisation, really understanding your story so that I can sell it to the world.</p>

  <p>As a communications professional and filmmaker what I bring to the table is a heightened knowledge of marketing trends. My ear is constantly to the ground for the latest analytics on what videos are being shared, I've had several of my videos go viral with hundreds of thousands of views, and how to convert views into sales, I've doubled the sales for one startup. I want to make the strongest marketing material for you, in addition to making something beautiful and innovative.</p>

  <p>In terms of filmmaking style, I like to pick out small details (using my favoured 50mm lens), creating an intimacy and mystery which draws in the viewer.</p>

  <p>If you’re nervous in front of the camera, then I have a great ability to relaxing participants and draw out a natural performance as you can see from the testimonials below.</p>
