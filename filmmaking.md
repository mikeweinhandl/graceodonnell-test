  <h2>How I Work</h2>
  <p>When we work together it is a truly collaborative process. What I’m best is understanding your needs. I take the time to get to know you and your organisation, really understand your story so that I can sell it best to the world.</p>

  <p>As a comms professional and filmmaker what I bring to the table is a heightened knowledge of marketing trends. My ear is constantly to the ground for the latest analytics on what causes video to be shared and to convert viewers into customers. I want to make the strongest marketing material for you, in addition to making something beautiful and innovative.</p>

  <p>In terms of filmmaking style I like to pick out small details (using my favoured 50mm lens) which can tell your story, creating an intimacy and slight mystery which draws in and engages the viewer.</p>

  <p>If you’re nervous in front of the camera, then I have a great knack for relaxing participants and drawing out a natural and relaxed performance.</p>

    <p>"Grace is friendly and easy to work with. We asked her to make a short video for our community organization. She arrived on site and put us all at ease before filming; this was important as not everyone had experience of being interviewed in front of a camera. We were very pleased with the result, and the video looks great. ."</p>
