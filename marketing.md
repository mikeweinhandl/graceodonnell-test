<!--HI THERE. I’M GRACE O DONNELL I’m a content strategist and writer. -->

After working with content in one form or another for about five years and as the content strategy and copywriting lead at a national membership organization for two years, I started freelancing full-time in 2015—and haven’t looked back since.

Today, I plan, create, and manage content for start ups, videographers, and travel/tourism companies.

I write websites, content marketing articles, and video scripts. I help consulting clients organize their thoughts and plot out blog strategies. I helped one client double their number of paying members from 9000 to 18000, another quadruple their web leads, and still another double the size of their film school business.

### A FEW PAST PROJECTS

From print brochures to big re-branding projects and from content strategies to blog posts, I’ve done a little bit of everything. Here are some projects I particularly liked:
